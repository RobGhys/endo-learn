# Endo Learn
The purpose is to make a multi-class model for 'endoscopid disesases' (probably need a better name for that).
Targets are:
- kvasir family
- private lung data
- crohn ipi
- others?

After training, we want to observe what a model has learned
So the MI part should start from there.
Idea: show what the neurons have learned
